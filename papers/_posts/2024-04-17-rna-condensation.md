# Abstract 

Stress-induced mRNP condensation is conserved across eukaryotes, resulting in stress granule formation under intense stresses, yet the mRNA composition and function of these condensates remain unclear. Exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following stress is thought to cause condensation and stress granule formation through mRNA-sequence-dependent interactions, leading to disproportionate condensation of long mRNAs. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNAs condense in response to multiple stresses in budding yeast with minor length dependence and often without stress granule formation. New transcripts escape mRNP condensation, enabling their selective translation. Inhibiting translation initiation causes formation of mRNP condensates that are distinct from stress granules and P-bodies; these translation-initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are omnipresent, even in unstressed cells. Stress-induced mRNAs are excluded from TIICs due to the timing of their expression, indicating determinants of escape that are independent of sequence. Together, our results reveal a previously undetected level of translation-linked molecular organization and stress-responsive regulation.
