# Summary 

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a fundamental technique in molecular biology to detect and quantify DNA and RNA.
Here we present the tidyqpcr software package for user-friendly qPCR analysis using the tidyverse suite of R packages. 
tidyqpcr offers a consistent user interface and structure for qPCR analysis, within the tidyverse paradigm of spreadsheet-like rectangular data frames and generic functions that build up complex analyses in a series of simple steps.
tidyqpcr focuses on experimental design in microwell plates, and relative quantification using changes in quantification cycle (âˆ†Cq).
Overall, tidyqpcr empowers scientists to conduct reproducible, flexible, and best-practice compliant quantitative PCR analysis. 

# Notes

Try it for analysing your qPCR data!
This was a fun experience of software peer review with the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) community.
See also our [blog post for eLife explaining tidyqpcr](https://elifesciences.org/labs/f23e268f/tidyqpcr-quantitative-pcr-analysis-in-the-tidyverse).

Also note: the inclusion of a DRAFT watermark in the published paper pdf was an accident, that we don't know how to fix. Ah well.
