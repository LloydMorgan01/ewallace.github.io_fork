We've been working to create training material on [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/good-enough-practices/index.html).
This is freely available and we hope you find it useful!
It's a result of teamwork over many years, in collaboration with [The Carpentries organization](https://carpentries.org), that teachesfoundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

[See blogpost for more about the material](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/03/good-enough-practices-carpentries-lab/).
