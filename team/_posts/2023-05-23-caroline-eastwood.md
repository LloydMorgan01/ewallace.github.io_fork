Caroline pursued her Master's degree in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. She joined the Wallace lab in May 2023 to do a bioinformatics dissertation project titled "A Modern Bioinformatics Pipeline to Understand Protein Synthesis from Big Data". Leveraging the robust and reliable ribosome profiling analysis software package, "riboviz 2", Caroline aims to build a more user-friendly ribosome profiling analysis pipeline using Nextflow DSL2.

Caroline previously graduated with a degree in Medical Biochemistry from Swansea University in 2021.
