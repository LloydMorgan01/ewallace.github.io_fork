She completed her PhD in 2018 at the Univeristy of Edinburgh, on the structure and biochemistry of bacterial microcompartment proteins, working with [Jon Marles-Wright](http://www.marles-wright-lab.org/).
Laura's main project was building a _Cryptococcus neoformans_ reporter gene toolkit and new fluorescent proteins. This is still in progress, contact us for details!

Laura contributed to several other projects in the lab. 
Laura was funded by the Wellcome Trust and by the [Wellcome Trust's ISSF3 award](https://www.ed.ac.uk/medicine-vet-medicine/research-support-development-commercialisation/issf).
