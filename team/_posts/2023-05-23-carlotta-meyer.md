Carlotta studied for a MSc in Bioinformatics at Edinburgh.
She joined the Wallace lab in May 2023 and completed a project titled "A bioinformatic pipeline for single-molecule RNA image analysis in budding yeast".
Carlotta wrote a pipeline to enable fully automated analysis of yeast smFISH images, quantifying the localisation of mRNA for different genes, using different tools and packages including big-fish, napari, skimage and cellpose 2.0. 
She also made the pipeline accessible for non-expert users with little programming background.
Carlotta worked closely with [Marah Jnied](marah-jnied).

Carlotta completed a BSc in Natural Sciences (Biology and Chemistry) at Durham University in 2021 and would like to pursue a career in coding tools and pipelines to aid biological research.
